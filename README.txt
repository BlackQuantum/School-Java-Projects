- In this repo I have put some of the School projects I have been working so that others can explore and help me make my programs better and more efficient

- I would like anybody to give me some input on what they think so I put a runnable jar in the downloads go check it out

- to find my java file go into the Program folder then into the src file and it should be there

- Comment and Thanks for Helping

-Enjoy!!!
