========================
GAL Assembler & Simulator Operation
========================

The file to assemble and simulate must be located in the same directory folder as the assembler's "GAL.jar" file. 

The file to assemble must be in "plain text" format. 
- Under Mac OSX: use TextEdit to create and edit your assembly code file. 
	Select "Format->Make Plain Text" before you save the file. 
	Also go under info and delete the ".txt" extension on the filename.
- Under Windows: use Notepad to create and edit your assembly code file.

Double click the "GAL.jar" file to begin the GAL assembler. If no assembly errors are encountered, the program is automatically executed in the GAL simulator. 

Note: Execution of GAL requires Java 6 under both OSX and Windows.
